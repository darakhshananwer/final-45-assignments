// Cars: Write a function that stores information about a car in a Object. The function should always receive
//  a manufacturer and a model name. It should then accept an arbitrary number of keyword arguments. Call the
//  function with the required information and two other name-value pairs, such as a color or an optional 
// feature. Print the Object thatâ€™s returned to make sure all the information was stored correctly.
